Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. EDA is performed on the given data records to find relationships, patterns in the data in order to make sure that the loan is availed to the customer who is capable of paying, and also making sure to avoid bias. Bussiness success constraint is to decrease the bias by atleast 90%.</p>

									<p>The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few
										decades, with a growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental
										sustainability, and technological innovation. With increasing
										competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape,
										it has become more important than ever to understand the factors that
										drive consumer demand for cars.
										In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and
										hybrid vehicles and increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as
										hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional gasoline powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types
										and grades available to consumers. Using analysis and visualization, I have seen many observations. Like
										which car manufacturer is leading among the car companies, their
										strategy to stand in the leading position. Based on the type of
										advertisement given by each company, its duration, their spend, etc.
										Many influencing factors were found and were used to solve the
										problem. The problem was solved in a way such that, the manufacturers
										can optimize their pricing, spends to increase the business, product
										development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting
										consumer demand.</p>
